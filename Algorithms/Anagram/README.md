# Anagram Algorithm

An Anagram is a word which is created by rearrange of the letters of another word. The word iceman is an anagram of cinema because you can rearrange the letters of either word to form the other. You can determine if two words are anagrams by sorting the letters in each word alphabetically and testing whether they are the same.
