# Sorting Algorithms

The sorting algorithm is used to sort data in some given order. It can be classified in Merge Sort and Bubble Sort.
- **Merge Sort** → it follows the divide et Impera rule. The given list is first divided into smaller lists and compares adjacent lists and then, reorders them in the desired sequence. So, in summary from unordered elements as input, we need to have ordered elements as output.
- **Bubble Sort** → it first compares and then sorts adjacent elements if they are not in the specified order.
