# Sequential Search Algorithm

A search algorithm finds information in a data structure such as a list. A sequential search is a simple search algorithm that checks each item in a data structure to see if the item matches what it is looking for.

If you were playing cards and looking for a specific card in the deck, you probably searched sequentially to find it. You went through each map in the game one by one, and if the map wasnâ€™t the one you were looking for, you moved on to the next map.

When you finally got to the map you wanted, you stopped. If you went through the entire deck without finding the map, you also stopped because you realized the map was not there.
